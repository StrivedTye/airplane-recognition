1. version 0.0
   New file structure has been designed for efficient work. Tye. 2020/11/30

2. version 0.1
   TestNoseLocation.py: [modified from TestHeadSegmentation.py] Mark, 2020/12/2
   util.make_video.py: [create]  Mark, 2020/12/2
   TestClassification.py: [modify] Mark, 2020/12/2

   Note 1: voting under equivalence class TO BE ADDED in TestClassification.py.
   Note 2: Dynamic updating mode is applied in both TestNoseLocation.py and TestClassification.py

3. version 0.2
   main.py: [created] Tye, 2020/12/03, automatically record results by log file.
   dataset.py [modified] Tye, 2020/12/03, merge "get_yaw" into the body of the "PlaneDataset" CLASS.
   The project is re-organized and now can conduct classifying and locating automatically.
   Some modifications have been made to adapt to current version, especially CLASS in TestClassification.py and SegmentScene.py

4. version 0.3
   pointnet.py: [modified] Tye, 2020/12/04,
     add "PointNetClsSeg" CLASS,
     change the way of extracting point-wise features

   dgcnn.py: [modified] Tye, 2020/12/04,
     add "DGCNNClsSeg" CLASS,
     change the way of extracting global and point-wise features

   net.py: [modified] Tye, 2020/12/04,
     define the cls-head and seg-head in different backbones,
     rewrite the "get_loss" CLASS, where we add the smoothed cross-entropy loss

   stn.py: [created] Tye, 2020/12/04,
     it contains the subnetworks for transformation. "STN3d", "STNkd" and "TransformNet" are declared.
     "TransformNet" is a special version designed for DGCNN.

   parts_gt.py: [created] Mark, 2020/12/04,
     it receives part labels and return the form suiting CE Loss of point-wise classification.

5 version 0.4
  TestPartSegmentation.py [created] Mark, 2020/12/05,
  this file is added for eval multi-parts segmentation and its visualization

  TestNoseLocation.py [modified] Mark, 2020/12/05,
  The original predicted_head is substituted to suit the multi-parts segmentation

  Note: the new cls loss raise errors (solved by Ybb)
  Note: if we load gt in dataloader, it suffers from .bin loading error
  Note:
